  # The commented out code below runs a code vulnerability scan on the
  # containerised app. This will not work on the free GitHub plan, since
  # for that plan code scanning is not supported for private repos - and
  # this is a private repo. There may be a work-around.

  # NOTE: If you uncomment this job to use it you may wish to change the
  # 'needs' in the below 'tag-container-push' job from 'test-package'
  # to 'anchore-scan' if you want to make a release dependent on a successful
  # scan.
